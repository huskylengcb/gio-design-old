Design language is a set of interconnected patterns guided by clear standards and shared practices coherently organized to achieve the purpose of digital products. It’s shared knowledge and understanding not only what we designed but why and how we designed this way. It evolving with the product growing.

are the repeating elements that we combine to create an interface: things like user flows, interactions, buttons, text fields, icons, colors, typography, microcopy.

- Practices and guidance

Practices are how we choose to create, capture, share and use those patterns, particularly when working in a team.
